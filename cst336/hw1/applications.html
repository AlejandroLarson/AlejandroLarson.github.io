                <h3>Maps and Navigation</h3>
                <p>Graphs can be used to represent maps where vertices are locations and edges are roads between them.
                    A special algorithm known as Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest path from one vertex
                     to every other vertex in the graph. If you were solving a maze, you could find a path from the start to the 
                      end by utilizing a traversal algorithm like depth-first search or breadth-first search.

                <h3>Social Media</h3>
                <p>Social media platforms make use of graphs all the time to represent users and relationships between them. If you wanted 
                    to suggest friends of friends, you could traverse the graph using breadth-first search. They often utilize hash tables to quickly
                    look up user profiles. Searching and sorting are very important in user databases.

                <h3>Images</h3>
                <p>An image can be represented by a 2D array of pixels where each pixel can take on various RGB values.
                    If you wanted to manipulate the image, it would require traversing the array and updating pixels using a 
                    particular formula.
