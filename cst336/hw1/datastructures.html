                <p>Description: An array is a sequence of n items of the same data type that are stored
                    contiguously in computer memory and made accessible by specifying the array's index value.

                <h3>Linked List</h3>
                    <p>Description: A linked list is a sequence of zero or more elements called nodes,
                        each containing two kinds of information: some data and one or more links called pointers 
                        to other nodes of the linked list. This does not have to be stored contiguously in memory. In a singly linked list, each node contains a single
                        pointer to the next element except the last one which is a null pointer.

                <h3>Graph</h3>
                <p>Description: A graph is formally defined as a pair of two sets, a set V of vertices and a set E of pairs of edges between the vertices.
                    If the set of edges is unordered, it's an undirected graph. If order matters, it's a directed graph. In a weighted graph the edges have a
                     weight or value associated with them. Graphs are represented either by an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
